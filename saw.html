<p>here is my tierlist</p>
<p style="font-size: 40px;">1: saw 2</p>
<p>saw 2 is easily the best saw movie in my opinion, the characters
    are great and enjoyable and it has a easy steady plot. 5/5 stars
</p>
<p style="font-size: 40px;">2: saw 3</p>
<p>saw 3 is a great one, it being set in the future is a really nice little twist
    and the ending is really good, overall one of my favs, also has my fav
    trap which is the rack.  4.5/5 stars
</p>
<p style="font-size: 40px;">3: saw </p>
<p> saw is a classic, two really lovable characters in one trap, its truely one of the
    best opening into a set of horror movies we have ever seen 4.5/5 stars
</p>
<p style="font-size: 40px;">4: saw 6</p>
<p>saw 6 being set from hoffmans persepctive is really cool, i loved the movie and loved
    seeing hoffman go crazy 4/5 stars
<p style="font-size: 40px;">5: saw 10</p>
<p> saw 10 was quite good for a modern movie, it was set really early in the past
    and it wasnt too bad, the traps were okay but i just wished they had killed off cecila 
    in a more brutal way 4/5 stars 
</p>
<p style="font-size: 40px;">6: saw 5</p>
<p> saw 5 was extremely hard to follow, but the ending made up for it, such a cinematic
    way of seeing strahm die, so brutal aswell. 3.5/5 stars
</p>
<p style="font-size: 40px;">7: saw 4</p>
<p> this was so confusing and the traps were okay at best, i dont really know
    about this one, not very memorable. 3/5 stars. </p>
