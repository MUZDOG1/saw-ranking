<p>here is my tierlist</p>
<p>1: saw 2</p>
<p>saw 2 is easily the best saw movie in my opinion, the characters
    are great and enjoyable and it has a easy steady plot.
</p>
<p>2: saw 3</p>
<p>saw 3 is a great one, it being set in the future is a really nice little twist
    and the ending is really good, overall one of my favs
