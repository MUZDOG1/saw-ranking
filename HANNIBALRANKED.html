<p style="color: white;">this is a quick little tier
    list of all the hannibal movies, and yes i will be ranking the tv show soon
    just not now
</p>
<p style="font-size: 40px; color: white;">1: the silence of the lambs</p>
<p style="color: white;" >the silence of the lambs truely is a cinematic masterpiece, every scene is impactful and 
    has true meaning, a young FBI trainee called
     claric starlingb who is set a task of interviewing a criminally insane doctor, aka serial killer, known as hannibal 
    lector, hannibal uses clarice to escape the asylum by asking for a change of prison in exchange for information on a new
    serial killer, while be moved, he murders two gaurds and escapes, setting out to kill his old aslyums warden and 
    kill even more! its a really good movie in the small series and its the movie that really gave thomas harris the 
    publicity he deserves, these are the reasons this is going in first place for me (also the book was amazing)
</p>
<p style="font-size: 40px; color: white;">2: hannibal (the movie) </p>
<p style="color: white;"> hannibal was a certainly interesting take on the book, it missed out on a lot of features from 
    the novel (such as the classic ending of clarice traveling the world with hannibal) which was quite annoying but i think
    they did a pretty good job on making  most of the books features and scenes into a movie, still not the best movie out 
    there.
