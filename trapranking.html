<h1> this is a tierlist of every single saw trap </h1>
<h1> 1: reverse bear trap</h1>
<p> the reverse bear trap is the best trap in the saw movies, it looks amazing and has the
    coolest death function, their jaw gets ripped open, its by far the most iconic out of 
    them all and is just overall a amazing trap, also we see amanda for the first time 
    so that is a plus.
