<p>here is my tierlist</p>
<p style="font-size: 40px;">1: saw 2</p>
<p>saw 2 is easily the best saw movie in my opinion, the characters
    are great and enjoyable and it has a easy steady plot. i loved every
    second watching it and thought it was really good, this movie started
    my love for the saw franchise and ultimately made me watch the rest, had some
    really good traps, had a really good script aswell. 5/5 stars
</p>
<p style="font-size: 40px;">2: saw 3</p>
<p>saw 3 is a great one, it being set in the future is a really nice little twist
    and the ending is really good, overall one of my favs, also has my fav
    trap which is the rack because it is extremely
    grusome. seeing a man go through utter hell then 
    seeing his wife die infront of once he succeded was insane, i can imagine
    how terrible that would of been, 4.5/5 stars
</p>
<p style="font-size: 40px;">3: saw </p>
<p> saw is a classic, two really lovable characters in one trap, its truely one of the
    best opening into a set of horror movies we have ever seen 4.5/5 stars
</p>
<p style="font-size: 40px;">4: saw 6</p>
<p>saw 6 being set from hoffmans persepctive is really cool, i loved the movie and loved
    seeing hoffman go crazy, also explained a crazy plottwist in saw 3 where
    amanda had to shoot lynn which was a insane scene. 4/5 stars
<p style="font-size: 40px;">5: saw 10</p>
<p> saw 10 was quite good for a modern movie, it was set really early in the past
    and it wasnt too bad, the traps were okay but i just wished they had killed off cecila 
    in a more brutal way 4/5 stars 
</p>
<p style="font-size: 40px;">6: saw 5</p>
<p> saw 5 was extremely hard to follow, but the ending made up for it, such a cinematic
    way of seeing strahm die, so brutal aswell. 3.5/5 stars
</p>
<p style="font-size: 40px;">7: saw 4</p>
<p> this was so confusing and the traps were okay at best, i dont really know
    about this one, not very memorable. 3/5 stars. </p>
