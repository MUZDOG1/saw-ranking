<h1 style="color: white;"> this is a tierlist of every single saw trap </h1>
<h1 style="color: white;"> 1: reverse bear trap</h1>
<p style="color: white;"> the reverse bear trap is the best trap in the saw movies, it looks amazing and has the
    coolest death function, their jaw gets ripped open, its by far the most iconic out of 
    them all and is just overall a amazing trap, also we see amanda for the first time 
    so that is a plus.

<h1 style="color: white;">2: the rack</h1>
<p style="color: white;">the rack is one of the coolest traps from saw 3 and made the movie 
    far better in my opinion, its such a grusome trap and you dont even get
    a chance to survive unless the other person saves you, its insanely good.

<h1 style="color: white;">3: the eyeball trap</h1>
<p style="color: white;">the eyeball trap from saw 10 is one of the coolest traps and its a serious
    shame that it was only in johns imagination, im suprised their werent 
    more eyeball traps in the past, as they are really good and grusome.

<h1 style="color: white;">4: the acid axe trap</h1>
<p style="color: white;">the one i am talking about is the final trap in saw 6 (im not talking
    about hoffman's reverse beartrap btw) the acid axe is extremely grusome, your
    fate lies in the person you betrayed and the axes swings down as inserts 
    skin eating acid inside of your body, slowly killing you, this is easily one of 
    my favs.

<h1 style="color: white;">the public execution</h1>
<p style="color: white;"> this trap is insane is every way, your last moments being viewed by
    a couple hundred people, it has to be the worst death, but one thing i hate about not just the trap
    but the entire movie is how red they made the blood, it looks awful.
